# Pandas

## Create DataFrame

Use the range functions we have looked at previously to create a DataFrame with three columns, the first column should contain the number 1-10 \(inclusive\), the second should contain the numbers 11-20, and the final column should contain 21-30. Give each column a suitable name. Finally, print out the DataFrame, followed by each column printed separately.

## Graph From File

Load the attached file into a DataFrame, then create a new DataFrame that contains only the first 20 rows. Then create a scatter plot using the first and third columns.

Note: the file does not contain any column headers, you'll need to make sure you tell Python what to call each of your columns when you create the first DataFrame.

## Filtered Graph

Create a graph as before in the previous exercise, but this time instead of only the first rows, use all the rows where the third column is larger than the first column.
