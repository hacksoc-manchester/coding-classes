# Week 4

## Rubbish calculator

Create a program that takes in two numbers from the user and adds them together. The program should output the result and if the result is greater than 100, it should tell the user it is a big number.

## When are you 100?

Create a program that gets the name and age of the user. Then calculate what year they will turn 100.
