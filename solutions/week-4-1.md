# Week 4

## Rubbish calculator

```python
first_number = int(input("Please give me a whole number: "))
second_number = int(input("Please give me another whole number: "))
result = first_number + second_number
print("The result is:")
print(result)
if result > 100:
    print("That was a big number")
```

## When are you 100?

```python
name = input("What is your name: ")
age = int(input("How old are you: "))
year = str((2014 - age)+100)
print(name + " will be 100 years old in the year " + year)
```
