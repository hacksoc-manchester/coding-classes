# Matplotlib

#### Part 1: Creating a line graph <a id="Part-1:-Loading-data-with-numpy"></a>

You'll want to start by importing **matplotlib.pyplot** as **plt** because no one wants to write so much stuff everytime they use the module.

Use **plt.plot\(\)** to plot the data we've provided for you in the table for this exercise.

You would need to store the data to be able to access it. After plotting the graph, add a title to it and labels to each axis to make the graph and table more readable.

**Extension:**

* Once you've finished the above assignment try to make the graph look better by adding individual marker for each data point on the graph change their colour \(You might have to do some research for this one!\)

#### Part 2: Plotting with Matplotlib <a id="Part-2:-Plotting-with-Matplotlib"></a>

Use **plt.scatter\(\)** to plot the data we've provided for you about the sales of ice cream against the temperature outside. Add labels to each axis and a title to the graph.

#### Part 3: Bar Charts <a id="Part-3:-Bar-Charts"></a>

Using the **plt.bar\(\)** function, create a barchart visualizing the choice of pets of UK household in 2018 once again using the table for the exercise. This exercise should be slightly tougher to complete as **plt.bar\(\)** has a more dissimilar syntax to the previous two functions used.

### Extension to all tasks <a id="A-fitting-challenge"></a>

Modify all the previous tasks to get their data from their respective text file down below. Read in the data from the file and store it before performing the same plotting functions. \(The graphs should remain the same after changing the approach to reading the data!\)
