# Week 6

## 0 Finish last weeks stuff!

There were a lot of exercises last week, try and finish the for/while loop exercises before attempting this weeks material on functions \(don't worry about completing the challenge problems though\).

## 1 Fun with Functions

#### 1.1 Maximal entertainment <a id="Maximal-entertainment"></a>

Create a function which takes in a list and prints out the biggest value in the list \(**don't** use pythons max\(\) function!\)

**Extension**

Instead, **return** the maximum value and print it outside of the function

#### 1.2 Sum thing to do <a id="Sum-thing-to-do"></a>

Create a function which accepts a **list** of numbers and prints the **sum** of all the numbers

**Extension**

Get your function to return the **average** value in the list \(You'll want to use len\(\)\)

**1.3 Developing a range of skills**

Create a function which mimics the function of range\(\), by returning a list of integers from the minimum value to the maximum value - 1 \(i.e. my\_range\(min, max\)\)

**Extension 1**

Use **default arguments** such that if the "min" argument is not given, the function starts counting from zero

**Extension 2** 

Try and implement the range function using recursion \(you can use another function to do the actual list creation, if you like, so long as it uses recursion!\)
